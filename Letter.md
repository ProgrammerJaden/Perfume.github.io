Dear visitors,

    This website aims to help me learn the basics of uploading my code in github 
    to make a personalized website link. Since I've been using codepen for a long 
    time in my years of coding and I really didn't like the codes still popping 
    up even when I finished my websites. So I tried to make my own site without 
    any need for charges and stumbled into github. But that's only the beggining 
    of a new journey for me as I will now make more and more useful things aside 
    from making websites for school/personal reasons. I hope this first step of
    me uploading my first github pages will lead me to something unique in the 
    future.

                                                                Yours truly,
                                                                ProgrammerJaden
